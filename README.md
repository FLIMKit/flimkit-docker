# flimkit-docker

The Docker images for [FLIMKit](https://github.com/FLIMKit/FLIMKit). Each one runs FLIMKit with its [web UI](https://github.com/FLIMKit/flimkit-web-ui), so the whole application is used from a browser with nothing installed on the client.

These builds used to live in the FLIMKit repository, where an image could only be rebuilt by cutting a FLIMKit release. Here they rebuild on their own: on a FLIMKit release, weekly for base image and dependency updates, or by hand for any version.

## Images

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 14500:14500 \
  -e FLIMKIT_PASSWORD=choose-a-password \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/data \
  -v /path/to/flimkit-config:/root/.flimkit \
  --name flimkit \
  alex1075/flimkit:latest
```

Then open **http://localhost:14500** and log in as `flimkit` with that password.

| Tag | Contents | Installed size |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` | FLIMKit and the web UI | ~1.4 GB |
| `desktop` | adds the noVNC desktop view on port 14501 | ~1.7 GB |
| `cellpose` | adds Cellpose and CPU torch, for "Apply cell mask" | ~2.4 GB |
| `cuda` | adds Cellpose and CUDA torch, `docker run --gpus all ...` | larger again |
| `rocm` | adds Cellpose and ROCm torch, `docker run --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri ...` | larger again |
| `cuda-headless` | the bridge API instead of the web UI, with Cellpose and CUDA torch | ~270 MB less than `cuda` |
| `rocm-headless` | the same for AMD | ~270 MB less than `rocm` |

GPU fitting in FLIMKit is torch, so every GPU image carries it whether or not Cellpose is installed.

Every tag is also published with its FLIMKit version, for example `0.13.5-latest` and `0.13.5-cuda`. Sizes are the unpacked filesystem measured inside the container; the download is smaller.

`latest` leaves out Cellpose and torch, which are over half the old image and are only needed by the Cellpose cell mask. Everything else — fitting, phasor, stitching, batch, the machine IRF builder — works there. Use `cellpose` if you want cell masking without a GPU.

It also leaves out the noVNC desktop, whose dependency tree (node, ghostscript, perl, a second system numpy) costs about 300 MB. `FLIMKIT_DESKTOP=1` therefore needs the `desktop` tag; on any other tag the container says so and carries on serving the web UI.

## Headless images

`cuda-headless` and `rocm-headless` serve [flimkit-bridge](https://github.com/FLIMKit/flimkit-bridge), the HTTP API that the QuPath and Fiji add-ons speak, instead of the browser UI. They carry no X server and no Tk, which is the right shape for a GPU node doing batch work or answering a viewer, rather than one showing somebody a browser.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --gpus all \
  --network host \
  -e FLIMKIT_BRIDGE_TOKEN=choose-a-token \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/data \
  --name flimkit-bridge \
  alex1075/flimkit:cuda-headless
```

**The bridge only answers requests whose `Host` header is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`**, which is what stops a web page in your browser reaching it. That check is on the header, not the socket, so publishing a port and pointing a client at `http://gpu-box:8765` returns 403. Reach it either with `--network host` from the same machine, or over an SSH tunnel so the client sees `localhost`:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8765:localhost:8765 you@gpu-box
```

Set `FLIMKIT_BRIDGE_TOKEN` and give clients the same token; without it the bridge mints a new one each start and writes it to `~/.flimkit/bridge.json`, which a client in another container cannot read. `FLIMKIT_BRIDGE_PORT` moves the port.

## Settings

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FLIMKIT_PASSWORD` | not set | Password for the web UI (user `flimkit`) and for the desktop view. Without it, anyone who can reach the port can use FLIMKit and browse `/data`. |
| `FLIMKIT_DESKTOP` | `0` | Set to `1` to also serve the full desktop through noVNC on port 14501, for the few windows the web UI does not cover. Publish that port too. |
| `FLIMKIT_GEOMETRY` | `1440x900` | Size of the virtual screen FLIMKit draws on |
| `TZ` | `Etc/UTC` | Time zone for log timestamps |

Mount your data at `/data` and the config at `/root/.flimkit`, which is where FLIMKit keeps expert settings, preferences and recent files. The container reports healthy once the web UI answers on `/healthz`.

**TrueNAS SCALE (Custom App):** paste `docker-compose.yaml` from this repository, edit the volume paths to match your pool, and set `FLIMKIT_PASSWORD`.

## Building

```bash
docker build --build-arg FLIMKIT_VERSION=0.13.5 -t flimkit:test .
```

One Dockerfile builds every variant. `FLIMKIT_EXTRAS` chooses the FLIMKit extras (`gui` or `gui,cellpose`) and `TORCH_INDEX` picks the torch wheel index, or leaves torch out entirely when empty. `FLIMKIT_WEB_UI` is the web UI to install, currently the GitHub archive until that package reaches PyPI.

FLIMKit itself is installed from PyPI rather than copied from a checkout, so an image is reproducible from its tag and the build cannot race the release that publishes it.

## How builds are triggered

| Trigger | What it builds |
|---|---|
| `repository_dispatch` of type `flimkit-release` | The version in `client_payload.version`, sent by FLIMKit after it publishes to PyPI |
| Weekly schedule | The newest FLIMKit on PyPI, so base image updates ship without a release |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Any version you name, with an option not to push |
| Pull request | Builds and smoke-tests without pushing |

Every variant is started and checked before anything is pushed: `/healthz` answers, the API refuses a request without the password, and returns the application state with it.

The workflow waits for the version to appear on PyPI before building, so it can be triggered the moment a release is published.

## Licence

MIT, same as FLIMKit.
